# Enhanced Early Cancer Detection via Multi-Omics cfDNA Fragmentation Integration Using an Early-Late Fusion Neural Network with Sample-Modality Evaluation
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation patterns—generated by nucleases acting on DNA released into biofluids—reflect layered epigenetic modifications and have emerged as promising biomarkers for early cancer detection. Integrating multiple levels of fragmentomic signals can enhance diagnostic performance; however, the high heterogeneity of fragmentation types combined with limited sample sizes poses significant challenges for multimodal data fusion. Here, we present Early-Late fusion with Sample-Modality evaluation (ELSM), a novel framework that combines a two-stage neural network fusion strategy with sample-wise modality evaluation to fully harness the complementary information in multi-omics cfDNA fragmentations. ELSM integrates 13 distinct fragmentomics and is evaluated on five datasets comprising 1,994 samples across 10 cancer types. Our approach consistently outperforms both unimodal classifiers and state-of-the-art multimodal fusion models in cancer detection and tissue-of-origin prediction tasks. Furthermore, biological analyses of key genomic regions associated with high-contributing modalities—as identified by the sample-modality evaluation module—demonstrate strong biological interpretability, underscoring the clinical potential of ELSM for real-world diagnostic applications.
